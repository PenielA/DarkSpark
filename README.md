## About our application
Due to COVID-19 social distancing has become a popular concept. Since It is very common for airports to be crowded, people might not feel safe traveling. Long waiting lines at TSAs, food joints and check in desks make traveling inconvenient even when there is no pandemic. Our application seeks to make travellers feel at ease by showing them crowded areas at the airport that they can avoid as well as the status of waiting lines enabling them to social distance and avoid any unnecessary waits.
